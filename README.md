## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software engineer in Cluj-Napoca. I build software and write about software.

As a software Engineer with over 10 years of experience, I enjoy solving business problems using code and communication.

I believe that simple is better than complex, and code must add business value from the second it is deployed.


## Technologies
The following is a list of technologies I specialize in and utilize:

Golang | Linux | Docker
