## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software engineer in Cluj-Napoca. I build software and [write](https://medium.com/@andreiboar) about software.

As a Software Engineer with over 10 years of experience, I enjoy solving business problems using code and communication.

I believe that simple is better than complex, and code must add business value from the second it is deployed.


## Technologies
The following is a list of technologies I specialize in and utilize:

Languages:	Go(8 years), PHP(7 years), Javascript, Typescrypt, SQL
Technologies: 	Linux, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microservices, AWS, React, Docker, Kubernetes, Laravel, Symfony
